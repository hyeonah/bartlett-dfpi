# Week 2 â€” Day 2 (Online)

Now that we are more comfortable with Terminal, Node.js, npm, and working with JSON and CSV data, we can start to create more interesting connections.

We will learn about:

- APIs
  - Fetching data e.g. hourly or daily
  - Writing data e.g. Twitter bot
- Creating your own APIs with Servers
  - Running Node.js in Glitch.com
  - Creating your own APIs
    - Random color server
    - ColourLover API
  - Idea: Color Namer Device
  - Multiplayer App


- Glitch.com Server Examples
  - "Hello World" Node.js app
  - Fetching Files Node.js app
  - WebSocket Demo (Unidirectional)
  - Websocket Demo (Bidirectional)
- "Isometric" JavaScript
  - Fetching Web APIs in the Browser
  - Fetching Web APIs in Node.js with `cross-fetch`
- WebSockets for bi-directional communication

## Assignment

The assignment will be one of the following:

- Generative Artwork
  - For example, using P5.js to create a series of images or a looping animation.
- Interactive Artwork
  - For example, a browser artwork that responds to mouse or mobile touch.
- Data Artwork
  - For example, a data visualization or data painting.
- Connected Artwork
  - For example, using WebSockets to communicate wirelessly between devices, and/or across the internet.
  - This may or may not include a hardware component such as Raspberry Pi and Enviro pHAT Sensor
  - Alternatively, this can run entirely on a server, such as a Twitter bot running on Glitch.com or Heroku.

Projects are either solo, or in a group of max 2 people. For Connected Artwork projects it may make sense to work in a team to split effort between frontend (visuals) and backend (networking).
