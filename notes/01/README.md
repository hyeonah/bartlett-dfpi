# Day 01

Today we learn:

- What is creative coding?
- What is generative art?
- What are some artists and examples in this space? (See references below)
- What tools do we need? (See tools below)
- The very basics of drawing shapes with code, algorithms, randomness, etc.

## Tools

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (preferred) or [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) Browser
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Terminal on macOS or [cmder](https://cmder.net/) for PC
- [Node.js + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch)

## Concepts

- Development environment (Node, npm, `canvas-sketch`, browser)
- Basic shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles, squares, lines)
- Syntax: variables, functions, for loops
- Colors: hex codes, RGB strings, HSL
- Importing utilities (randomness, color palettes)

## Exercise

Taking Sol LeWitt's instructions from Wall Drawing #130 (1972) and recreating the artwork with JavaScript.

Instructions: *Grid and arcs from four corners.*
