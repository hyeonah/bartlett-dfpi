# Day 02

Today we learn:

- What is a render loop?
- How do we introduce animation?
- How do we use sin()
- Transformations and rotations
- Interactions: mouse, keyboard
- Data structures: arrays, storing values
- Radial motion with sin() and cos()
- Begin Assignment: Bauhaus, research designers
- Exercise: Circle packing / Generative Artistry
- Extra: Equations for Organic Motion
- Extra: Robert Penner's Easing Equations
- Extra: Noise Functions

## Assignment

To be presented rather informally on Monday. Sharing your [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) code/animations with the class is optional at this stage.

1. *Research* various designers in the Bauhaus school, as well as those inspired by the school.

2. *Sketch* some algorithmic or rule-based design systems *on paper* that you feel more confidently able to create with code. This may be simply sketching a few design iterations in thumbnails, or it might involve sketching some cues and guides for motion. You may wish to start with one of the existing systems in the demo pages.

3. *Code* by remixing one of the existing demos, attempting to bring it closer to the Bauhaus style, artist, or designer you are specifically interested in.
