## Assignment

Start to think about your project. The assignment will be one of the following, and will be officially "assigned" tomorrow evening:

- Generative Artwork
  - For example, using P5.js to create a series of images or a looping animation.
- Interactive Artwork
  - For example, a browser artwork that responds to mouse or mobile touch.
- Data Artwork
  - For example, a data visualization or data painting.
- Connected Artwork
  - For example, using WebSockets to communicate wirelessly between devices, and/or across the internet.
  - This may or may not include a hardware component such as Raspberry Pi and Enviro pHAT Sensor
  - Alternatively, this can run entirely on a server, such as a Twitter bot running on Glitch.com or Heroku.

Projects are either solo, or in a group of max 2 people. For Connected Artwork projects it may make sense to work in a team to split effort between frontend (visuals) and backend (networking).
