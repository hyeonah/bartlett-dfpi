# Week 2 â€” Day 2 (Online)

Now that we are more comfortable with Terminal, Node.js, npm, and working with JSON data, we can start to create more interesting connections.

We will learn about:

- Programmable Web APIs
- Glitch.com Server Example
  - "Hello World" Node.js app
  - Fetching Files Node.js app
- "Isometric" JavaScript
  - Fetching Web APIs in the Browser
  - Reading `cross-fetch`
- WebSockets for bi-directional communication

## Assignment

The assignment will be one of the following:

- Generative Artwork
  - For example, using P5.js to create a series of images or a looping animation.
- Interactive Artwork
  - For example, a browser artwork that responds to mouse or mobile touch.
- Data Artwork
  - For example, a data visualization or data painting.
- Connected Artwork
  - For example, using WebSockets to communicate wirelessly between devices, and/or across the internet.
  - This may or may not include a hardware component such as Raspberry Pi and Enviro pHAT Sensor
  - Alternatively, this can run entirely on a server, such as a Twitter bot running on Glitch.com or Heroku.

Projects are either solo, or in a group of max 2 people. For Connected Artwork projects it may make sense to work in a team to split effort between frontend (visuals) and backend (networking).

At the end of class we will have time
