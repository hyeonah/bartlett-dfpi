# Final Assignment

The goal is to take what we've already learned and created and build it into a more polished and finalized piece. This could be the same continuation of what you've already been working on, or a fresh artwork now that you've overcome various challenges in the past few weeks.

### Brief/Theme

You can choose one or both brief to respond to:

1. RE-IMAGINING BAUHAUS —

2019 is the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus school. Celebrate its role in design and contemporary art by creating a new work that fits thematically within the ethos of the school and/or the style encompassed by its students.

2. GENERATIVE MACHINES —

Explore chaos and beauty from a simple set of rules, parameters, and algorithms — consider how an artwork can be augmented or disrupted by autonomous agents, emergent patterns, and generative algorithms. Can creativity emerge from a piece of code, or is it only by human-computer collaboration? What does this collaboration look like?

### Deadline

Due on **December 9, 2019**.

### Deliverables

Here are the deliverables:

- The Artwork
- 1 Artist Statement
- 4 PNG Files
- 1 Video
- 2 Process Assets
- Source Code

Put all the files within a ZIP titled: **NameSurname_WorkTitle.zip**.

#### The Artwork

- This might be a link to an online [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) website, or a ZIP of a project that is run locally, or a combination of software and hardware (e.g. code + Raspberry Pi) with instructions on how to get the project running

- If your artwork requires interaction such as using the keyboard, you must provide documentation on how to interact with it (either directly in the artwork, or written elsewhere that is easy for me to discover). The description could be as simple as "Use your mouse to influence the design" or more complicated depending on your project.

#### One (1) Artist Statement

- One page A4-size PDF

- Title of Artwork

- Includes an Artist Statement on the Artwork: 100-250 words

  - Explaining what the artwork is, why it is interesting, how it responds to the brief, and (optionally) some technical details

- (Optional but suggested) Try to type-set this in so that it looks clean and designed.

  - Example template [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O6zvp_-x9eNVIPn5tadrfJ5rKViszUT8-ZIwIgHpQtw/edit?usp=sharing) but students are encouraged to come up with their own design/layout

- You may or may not wish to include images, figures, or drawings to help augment this document

#### Four (4) PNG files

- For example, screenshots of the project running

- No smaller than 1080px in either dimension

- You can right click the canvas and click "Save As" to get a PNG

#### One (1) Video

- This can be an export from your coded artwork (example [here](https://vimeo.com/278407486)), OR it can be a documentation video showing the artwork being interacted with (example [here](https://vimeo.com/292088058))

#### Two (2) "Process" Assets

It can be _any combination_ of the below, choose _only two_ assets in total:

- Links to a Glitch.com prototype or one of the sketches you did prior to the final project, which helped lead up to it

- Photos/scans of sketches with pen on paper, such as the drawings we did inspired by Sol LeWitt instructions

- A video showing the "making-of" or "behind the scenes" of you working with the project (see an example [here](https://vimeo.com/244830772))

- Early screenshots of the project during development

- A video of the early prototype running at Tate Late

#### Source Code

- This can be published on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), [GitHub.com](http://github.com/), or as a ZIP with JavaScript, HTML and any other files

- _Note:_ If you publish on Glitch make sure you do not rename your project later on, otherwise I won't be able to see the code!

- Include comments in the code with `/* comment */` and `// comment` to help guide us through your thinking

- If you have a specific way of starting your project (for example any terminal commands needed) you need to describe that in a `README.md` or `README.txt` file

# Assessment Criteria

Assignments will be assessed on the following **3** criteria:

- **Communication** (task structure, clarity of intent)

  - This includes documentation (PDF, overall design, artist statement, etc)

  - Clarity of code; for example comments, use of functions to break larger functionality into smaller pieces, organized project structure, etc.

  - Clarity of project; for example ease of use

- **Achievement** (acquisition of skill taught)

  - For example, how well you achieved what you set out to do, and/or artistic achievement

  - Showing how your project goes above and beyond

  - Showing the skills you've learned in the last few weeks (Graphics, Motion, Connectivity, Audio, and/or Sensors)

- **Difficulty** (ambition of task objective)

  - For example, going for something ambitious rather than simply re-mixing a class demo

  - Whether you've gone above the visual demos you presented for consideration at Tate, and produced something more cohesive and well-thought
