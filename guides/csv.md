# Comma Separated Values (CSV)

The CSV format is a common way that data is stored. It acts like a table or spread sheet, with rows and columns.

For example, let's say we found a data source of *Weather Data in NYC (2016)* ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/mathijs/weather-data-in-new-york-city-2016)), it might look like this.

| date     | maximum temperature | minimum temperature | average temperature | precipitation | snow fall | snow depth | 
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|------------| 
| 1-1-2016 | 42                  | 34                  | 38.0                | 0.00          | 0.0       | 0          | 
| 2-1-2016 | 40                  | 32                  | 36.0                | 0.00          | 0.0       | 0          | 
| 3-1-2016 | 45                  | 35                  | 40.0                | 0.00          | 0.0       | 0          | 
| 4-1-2016 | 36                  | 14                  | 25.0                | 0.00          | 0.0       | 0          | 

(And so on for all days through the year.)
